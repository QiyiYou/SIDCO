This package contains proof-of-concept source code for the results presented in:
C. Rusu N. Gonzalez and R. W. Heath Jr., Algorithms for the Construction of Incoherent Frames Under Various Design Constraints, 2017.

Tested on Matlab R2014a.
For problems, bug reports, comments and other contact C. Rusu.
Needs the CVX library:
M. Grant and S. Boyd, CVX: Matlab software for disciplined convex programming, version 2.1," http://cvxr.com/cvx, 2014
